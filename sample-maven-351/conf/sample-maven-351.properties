# A special file named 'attivio.properties' can be added to the project conf directory 
# to manage installation related configuration information such as data, log and tmp directories
# and log settings.  This file will NOT be managed by dynamic configuration so user should NOT
# place any properties in it that are referenced in normal configuration files.
